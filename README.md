**Project Title:** Predicting Bike Sharing Demand

This captivating project delves into the fascinating world of bike-sharing demand prediction. It's a predictive modeling task aimed at determining how many bikes will be rented based on various environmental and seasonal factors.

In this project, I leveraged a rich dataset containing features such as date, time, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The goal was to build a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately forecasting bike rental counts. 

Through data exploration, feature engineering, and the implementation of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, I tackled the challenge of predicting bike demand with enthusiasm. The project not only showcases my data science and machine learning skills but also my commitment to creating real-world solutions.
